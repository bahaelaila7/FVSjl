# FVSjl — port & validation status

_Last updated 2026-08-24. Branch `kt-variant-port` (mainline; `master` tracks the
validated state). Hard gate: `test/integration/test_multicycle.jl` = **339 pass / 11
broken, byte-identical**._

FVSjl is a Julia reimplementation of the USFS Forest Vegetation Simulator — a drop-in
replacement for the live Fortran FVS (same `.key`/`.tre` in, same SQLite/`.sum` out).
The validation doctrine is **bit-exact-or-cornered vs the live relinked Fortran
oracle** (`FVS{v}_g16`, gfortran-16), measured per subsystem/chunk, never inferred.

**"Cornered"** means a divergence that was *measured* and reduced to a named
floating-point primitive — the #206 OLDRN serial-correlation growth straddle (active
when DGSD≥1), the RDPSRT unstable-quicksort self-thin tie-break, a DGSCOR/volume ULP —
**not** an unexplained difference. (Caveat, learned the hard way: a "cornered" label
is a best-effort verdict, and re-measurement has occasionally found a real bug hiding
behind one — so corners are periodically re-audited against the live oracle.)

## Geographic variants (24) — all ported & validated

| Cluster | Variants |
|---|---|
| Eastern | Southern (SN), Northeast (NE), Central States (CS), Lake States (LS) |
| Western Rockies | Central Rockies (CR), Kootenai (KT), Inland Empire (IE), Eastern Montana (EM), Blue Mountains (BM), Teton (TT), Utah (UT), Central Idaho (CI) |
| Pacific / coastal | Central California (CA), East Cascades (EC), West Cascades (WC), West Sierra (WS), South Central Oregon (SO), Klamath/NC, Pacific Northwest (PN), Oregon Coast (OC, ORGANON), Olympic (OP, ORGANON) |
| Other | British Columbia (BC), Ontario (ON), Southeast Alaska (AK) |

Each has growth + volume, and most have FFE/ECON/mistletoe/Climate/establishment,
validated bit-exact-or-cornered vs the live oracle per subsystem.

## FIA behaviour-compat validation

**Eastern four — EXHAUSTIVE (full FVS-ready FIA population).** Every stand projected
the full horizon, all 10 `.sum` columns/cycle vs freshly-relinked live FVS
(`docs/fia_fullscale_results.md`, `data/fia_sweep.db`):

| Variant | Stands | bit-exact-or-cornered |
|---|--:|--:|
| SN | 633,628 | 99.994% |
| NE | 178,148 | 99.991% |
| CS | 255,951 | 99.986% |
| LS | 400,649 | 99.988% |
| **Total** | **1,468,376** | **99.990%** |

The 77 residual `needs_dig` all classify to named cornered primitives; the 60
`live_crash` are cases where **live FVS itself** SIGFPEs on extreme FIA geometry while
FVSjl runs clean.

**Western / non-eastern (20) — large sweeps done; full-population sweep to the eastern
standard is under way** (`docs/WESTERN_FIA_MORTALITY_SWEEP_2026-08-06.md`, per-variant
regime samples, and the in-progress `docs/WESTERN_FIA_FULLSCALE_*.md`).

## Extensions

FFE fire, FVS-Climate, **WWPB beetle + PPE landscape**, Western Root Disease, dwarf
mistletoe, budworm/tussock/beetle insect models, COVER, Event Monitor, ECON, DBS
database output, establishment — all validated bit-exact-or-cornered.

**PPE (Parallel Processing Extension) landscape** — the recovered-source harness
(deleted from the FVS tree in 2014, rebuilt from git history at `bc6e2377^`; a runnable
historical `FVSppe` oracle lives at `/workspace/.ppework/FVSppe`):
- **mode-1** (independent per-stand projection + area-weighted aggregation) — the
  CMADDS/CMPRT2 composite aggregation is **bit-exact vs the FVSppe COMPOSITE table**;
- **mode-2** (interstand beetle dispersal) — the spatial-redistribution kernels
  (`bmatct_multi!`/`bmdrv_multi!`) are **bit-exact vs pristine `bmatct.f` goldens**;
  live in-run cross-stand coupling is being wired (an equivalence-validated refactor).

## Known exceptions / not-yet-closed

- **ADDTREES** — external program, no in-tree source. Not ported.
- **PPE mode-2 *live* per-cycle coupling** — kernels bit-exact; the in-run lockstep
  driver is in progress (validated by live-vs-premade-decision equivalence, since the
  recovered `FVSppe` links the beetle no-op stub for EC).
- **ON database-read path** — no real ON DB data + a characterized gcc-16×sqlite
  SIGSEGV; ON is validated via the inline path, not a live DB oracle.
- **Western full-population FIA sweep** — under way; not yet at the eastern
  exhaustiveness.
