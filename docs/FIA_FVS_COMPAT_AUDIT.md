# FIA/FVS behaviour-compatibility — working checklist / audit

Goal + doctrine: `docs/FIA_FVS_COMPAT_GOAL.md`. Every slice: plots covered, per-cycle pass rate vs
freshly-relinked live FVS, divergences found → both-sides-traced → fixed or cornered. Never regress the
floor (`julia --project=. test/runtests.jl` = 38527/143/0).

## Infra fixes
- **F1** — `test/harness/fia/validate_fia.jl`: fixed `FVSjl.NorthEast()` → `Northeast()` (would have
  errored EVERY NE FIA stand). Made the harness CLI-arg driven (`julia validate_fia.jl <listfile>
  <SN|NE|CS|LS>`) so it's reusable for the campaign. Committed.

## Slice 1 (Pillar 2 probe) — SN multi-cycle drift is REAL and must be characterized
First multi-cycle differential (3 SN plots from `/tmp/fia_val/sn_feas.txt`, NUMCYCLE 5, 6 stand cols vs
live FVSsn). Result — mean |rel diff| by cycle:

| cyc | TPA | BA | SDI | CCF | TopHt | QMD |
|----:|----:|---:|----:|----:|------:|----:|
| 0 | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% |
| 1 | 0.04% | 0.5% | 0.16% | 0.14% | 0.0% | 0.46% |
| 3 | 1.0% | 0.96% | 0.66% | 0.37% | 0.0% | 1.15% |
| 5 | 1.86% | 1.23% | 0.98% | 0.49% | 0.0% | 1.54% |

Worst stand 3.9% (3237541010661). **Cycle-0 bit-exact** (confirms the inventory reader); the drift is
**purely in the projection** and **grows with cycle**. **TopHt = 0.0% every cycle** ⇒ heights match; the
divergence is **DBH-driven** (BA/SDI/QMD directly, TPA via density-dependent mortality).

**Hypothesis (to prove/refute, Pillar 4):** the DGSCOR diameter serial-correlation / grown-Float32
accumulation tail — the SAME accepted class as the `test_multicycle` / `test_dbs_compute` MYBA/MYSDI
`@test_broken`s. BUT the curated snt01/net01 stands are bit-exact multi-cycle, so a ~2-4% drift on real
plots is either (a) that tail hitting harder on these species mixes / larger diverse stands, or (b) a
REAL FIA-specific gap (a species DG coefficient or calibration path these plots trigger that the curated
tests don't). Doctrine #3/#4: root-cause the worst offender BOTH-SIDES before cornering. Next slice:
per-cycle per-species trace of 3237541010661 (are its drivers the WK3-calibrated sp33/65 family = accepted,
or a clean species that SHOULD be bit-exact = real gap?), then scale the differential to all 4 variants.

### Slice 1b — worst-stand species composition (classification clue)
Both worst SN stands are **diverse mixed-species hardwood plots**: 3237541010661 = 5 species
(FIA 68/407/835/541/462), 3196569010661 = **12 species** (FIA 826/837/621/318/931/541/409/701/544/521/
491/404). This matches the documented `test_allspecies` verdict: a diverse many-species stand
"accumulates every species' sub-ULP per-cycle DBH-growth + tripling-spread residual into the nonlinear
density/volume sums = the ACCEPTED aggregate DGSCOR + tripling class." Real FIA plots are inherently
multi-species (unlike the clean curated single/few-species tests), so they AMPLIFY that same cornered
primitive — a strong hypothesis that the ~2-4% drift is the accepted class, not a new gap.

**DECISIVE next diagnostic (do NOT assume — doctrine #3/#4):** the `test_treeszcp` method — compare
PER-TREE DG jl-vs-live (via FVS_TreeList DBS or a debug-FVS dgdriv stamp) on one worst stand. If per-tree
DG is bit-exact to ~1 ULP and only the AGGREGATE sums drift, it IS the accepted grown-Float32/DGSCOR
accumulation class (corner it). If a specific species' per-tree DG diverges beyond ULP, it's a REAL gap
(fix it). Also worth checking: cycle LENGTH used (non-native-cycle DGSCOR is a separate documented
deferred residual — fvsjl-scenario-sweep-findings #2).

### Slice 1c — DEFAULT (drop-in) trajectory pinpoints a SYSTEMATIC diameter-growth drift (stand 3196569010661)
Ruled out cheap causes first (doctrine #3): **cycle length = 5-yr = SN native** (1998→2023, NOT the
non-native-cycle DGSCOR issue); **NOTRIPLE does NOT converge** them (jl 408 vs live 415 TPA @2003 — a
NOTRIPLE-path confound, not the default behaviour). The apples-to-apples DEFAULT (tripled) comparison:

| year | jl TPA/BA/SDI | live TPA/BA/SDI | BA Δ |
|-----:|---------------|-----------------|-----:|
| 1998 | 416/102/195 | 416/102/195 | 0 (bit-exact cyc0) |
| 2003 | 408/114/214 | 408/115/215 | 1 |
| 2008 | 396/125/231 | 394/128/234 | 3 |
| 2013 | 378/135/244 | 375/139/248 | 4 |
| 2018 | 362/146/259 | 358/151/264 | 5 |
| 2023 | 347/157/273 | 343/163/278 | 6 (3.7%) |

**Signature:** TPA tracks closely (Δ0–4); **BA drifts SYSTEMATICALLY and ONE-DIRECTIONALLY — jl BA always
LOWER**, 0→6 (3.7%) over 5 cycles; TopHt exact all cycles. ⇒ seed = **jl diameter growth marginally but
systematically below live's**, compounding into BA/SDI (and slightly higher TPA via reduced density
mortality).

**Verdict discipline (doctrine #3/#4):** this is **NOT yet cornered**. It is (a) directional (pure Float32
ULP is not) and (b) ~3.7% BA — orders of magnitude larger than the accepted `dbs_compute` MYBA/MYSDI
DGSCOR ULP (~4 ULP / 1.2e-4). A systematic directional diameter-growth bias on diverse real SN plots must
be root-caused per-tree before any corner. It could still resolve to the accepted class (if it's the
sp33/65 WK3-calibrated species' serial-correlation compounding one way on these mixes) OR be a REAL small
DG gap a curated few-species test never exercised. **This is the campaign's first substantive open divergence.**

### Slice 1d — ROOT-CAUSE: yellow-poplar large-tree diameter growth ~20% LOW (REAL gap, NOT cornered)
Per-tree DG differential (live FVS_TreeList `DBH,DG` via `TREELIST`+`TreeLiDB`→FVSOut.db; jl per-tree
`s.trees.diam_growth` direct from the engine; matched by sorted initial DBH — cycle-0 bit-exact). Result
on stand 3196569010661, cycle 1998→2003:

- **Most trees: dDG = 0.0 (BIT-EXACT diameter growth).**
- A subset — **all yellow-poplar (FVS `YP`, FIA 621)**, the large fast-growing ones — jl DG is
  **systematically ~20–25% LOW**:

| initDBH | species | live DG | jl DG | Δ |
|--------:|:--------|--------:|------:|----:|
| 8.0 | YP | 0.712 | 0.558 | −0.155 |
| 11.9 | YP | 0.873 | 0.682 | −0.191 |
| 13.3 | YP | 0.635 | 0.495 | −0.140 |
| 14.5 | YP | 0.902 | 0.704 | −0.198 |
| 14.7 | YP | 1.029 | 0.804 | −0.225 |
| 17.9 | YP | 1.019 | 0.794 | −0.225 |

Co-large white ash (WA, DBH 11.8, live DG 0.709) was **bit-exact** ⇒ the gap is **species-specific to
yellow-poplar**, not a general large-tree issue. This ~20% per-cycle YP DG deficit compounds into the
observed 3.7%-BA/5-cycle stand drift (YP is a dominant large-tree component of these mixed hardwood plots).

**VERDICT: a REAL DG gap — NOT ULP, NOT cornered.** Directional, ~20% relative, single species. First real
bug of the campaign. Root-cause = trace the SN yellow-poplar large-tree DG (`dgf`/`dds` coefficients +
size terms) in FVS blkdat/dgf vs jl's coefficients; small YP are ~exact, large YP low ⇒ a DBH-dependent
term (dbh/dbh²/ln(dbh) or a size cap) for YP. **This is the next fix (Pillar 4), keeping the 38527/143/0 floor.**

NOTE also: jl loaded **36** tree records vs live **37** at cycle 0 for this stand (.sum TPA was bit-exact,
so likely a zero-TPA/merged record) — track separately.

### Slice 1e — mechanism leads (FVS SN dgdriv.f), YP coefficients located
- jl YP DG coefficients: `data/southern/species_coefficients.csv:46` (sp 45, YP, FIA 621). YP already has
  a documented SN special-case in HTCALC (`height_growth.jl:20`) — SN frequently special-cases YP.
- **Prime suspect (dgdriv.f:537-538):** "trees that have GREATER DBH THAN THE LARGEST TREE IN THE GROWTH
  SAMPLE are ASSIGNED THE PREDICTED RESIDUAL FOR THE LARGEST TREE IN THE GROWTH SAMPLE." This is the
  large-tree DGSCOR/COR residual **extrapolation** for DBH beyond the species' growth-sample max. If these
  FIA yellow-poplars are LARGER than any YP in the curated snt01 sample, jl's beyond-sample YP extrapolation
  runs for the first time — and is ~20% low. Fits "small YP exact, large YP low." (Distinct from the
  accepted sp33/65 WK3 tail — this is a LARGER, YP-specific effect.)
- Secondary: `dgdriv.f:741` `DGBND` (bounds on DG value) — large trees may hit a bound jl computes differently.
- Next: debug-FVS stamp dgdriv.f (the sp/DBH/DGSCOR-residual for YP on this stand) + read the jl large-tree
  DG path; find where large-YP DG diverges; fix keeping 38527/143/0. Then re-run the per-tree differential.

### Slice 1f — DGBND ruled out; reframed as a uniform YP DDS offset (size-amplified)
- **DGBND ruled out (both-sides):** jl YP `dg_bound_dbh_lo/hi` = 998/999 (sentinel = no range adjustment);
  FVS `DLODHI(45,·)` = 998.0/999.0 too (dgbnd.f I=31,45 block, 15th pair). Faithfully absent on both.
- jl base DDS (diameter_growth.jl:175-183) = conspp + intercept + ln_dbh·ln(d) + dbh_sq·d² + ln_crown·ln(icr)
  + rel_ht·relht + stand_ba·ba + point_bal·pbal + ft_coef + planted·kplant. (`dg_site_index` is folded into
  the per-stand constant via `dgcons!`, not a per-tree term.) YP coeffs: intercept −2.513351, ln_dbh 1.495351,
  dbh_sq −0.000756, ln_crown 0.530123, rel_ht 0.161718.
- **REFRAME:** DG = f(DDS, dbh) amplifies a CONSTANT ln-space DDS error for large dbh. So a DG deficit that
  grows with tree size is the signature of a **uniform YP DDS offset**, NOT necessarily large-tree-specific
  logic. Candidates: the folded site-index term (dgcons!), `dg_const[YP]`, `dg_cor[YP]` default, or a base
  coefficient — any small YP-constant error shows up big only on large YP.
- **DECISIVE next (debug-FVS, doctrine #6):** dgf.f already has `IF(DEBUG)WRITE ... 'IN DGF, I=,ISPC=,DDS='`
  (line 376) + a RELHT/DG5/DDS stamp (365). Run the stand with DEBUG (or stamp dgf.f), dump DDS + each term
  for a large YP tree; dump jl's DDS+terms for the same tree; the divergent term names the fix. Restore
  source + rebuild clean .o + verify oracle pristine.

### Slice 1g — ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: jl omits the SN ecological-unit (EUT) diameter-growth term
Debug-FVS DDS dump (dgf.f DEBUG) vs jl per-tree ln(DDS): **jl is UNIFORMLY 0.344 below FVS for EVERY YP
tree** (14.7: FVS 3.3614/jl 3.0175; 8.0: 2.2383/1.8945; 17.9: 3.7659/3.4221 — Δ=−0.344 exactly, all DBH/ICR).
A perfectly uniform ln(DDS) offset ⇒ a per-species CONSTANT-term error (amplified in DG space for big trees,
hence "large-YP-only"). Also refuted en route: crown variable (FVS `ICR`=25/35/45 == jl `crown_pct` ✓),
DGBND (both 998/999 ✓).

**CAUSE:** FVS STDINFO for this stand = **ECOLOGICAL UNIT `223Db`** (FOREST-LOCATION 80215). FVS dgf.f adds a
per-species **ecological-unit (EUT) categorical term** selected by that eco unit (dgf.f:1039 "EXAMINE THE
STAND ECOLOGICAL UNIT VARIABLE"; SN `dg_phys_*` coefficients p221/p222/p232/…). **jl's `s.plot.eco_unit` is
BLANK** ⇒ `_dgf_phys_group` returns `none` ⇒ `dgcons!` adds ZERO EUT term. YP's EUT coefficient for group
223 is large (~+0.255, `dg_phys_p222`-class) so YP loses it; white ash's ~0 ⇒ WA stayed bit-exact. (A small
forest-type-term difference — jl derives `forest_type=503→upok`, FVS may classify differently — likely
accounts for the remaining ~0.09.) The FIA reader reads `LOCATION=80215` but does NOT populate the
ecological unit → the whole EUT DG term is dropped for FIA-DB stands.

**THE FIX (next slice):** populate `s.plot.eco_unit` from the FIA STANDINIT ecological-unit field, and
confirm `_dgf_phys_group("223Db")` maps to the correct SN group (223→p222-class). Validate: re-run the
per-tree DG diff (expect YP Δ→0) + the stand differential (expect the 3.7% BA drift to collapse), and the
full suite MUST stay 38527/143/0 (the EUT term is inert when eco_unit is genuinely blank — snt01 etc. don't
set it — so no floor risk). This is a real FIA-reader + DG-constant gap, NOT ULP.

### Slice 1h — FIX LANDED + VALIDATED: FIA reader now reads ECOREGION → eco_unit (SN EUT DG term)
**Fix:** `apply_fia_stand!` (src/io/fia_database.jl) now reads the `ECOREGION` STANDINIT column (e.g.
"223Db") into `p.eco_unit` via `resolve_eco_unit`→SNECU (canonical "223DB"), SN-gated. This restores the
SN dgf ecological-unit (EUT) categorical term (`dg_phys_p222 = +0.2554` for group 223→p222) that was
dropped for all FIA-DB stands.

**Validated (stand 3196569010661):**
- YP per-tree ln(DDS) deficit: **−0.344 → −0.0886** (the p222 term = +0.2554, exactly as predicted).
- Stand `.sum` vs live: **BIT-EXACT all cycles** (2003 408/115/215, 2013 375/139/248, 2023 343/163/278 ==
  live) — the **3.7% BA drift collapsed to 0**. The residual −0.089 ln(DDS) forest-type term (jl upland_oak
  −0.0907 vs FVS ~0) is below the `.sum` integer-rounding threshold here.
- **Floor held: 38527 pass / 143 broken / 0 fail** — no regression (SN-gated FIA-path change; curated
  scenarios set eco_unit via STDINFO, unaffected; cycle-0 FIA baseline is DG-independent).

★ First campaign divergence FOUND → both-sides ROOT-CAUSED → FIXED → validated BIT-EXACT vs live, floor
preserved. Textbook FIA-behaviour-compat slice.

### Slice 1i — batch validation: eco_unit fix is BROAD (5/8 SN stands now bit-exact)
8-stand SN multi-cycle differential post-fix (`validate_fia.jl`): **5/8 stands now 0.0% (bit-exact all
cycles)** — the traced stand 3196569010661 PLUS 3237541010661, 3237540010661, 255262477010854,
1152014712290487 (all drifted pre-fix). Mean BA drift @cyc5: ~1.2% → **0.14%**. Confirms the EUT fix
corrected the whole FIA sample's DG, not one stand. Remaining drifters → next targets:
- **255260379010854 — 6.7%** (worst; also a known cyc0 TopHt AVH stand from modernization #92).
- **1152014752290487 — 6.5%**.
- 255262502010854 — 2.5%.
(One stand shows cyc0 TopHt 0.83% = the pre-existing 3/162 AVH-tie cyc0 residual, not new.)

### Slice 1j — residual SN stands classified: 1 ACCEPTED, 1 NEW (loblolly DG)
- **255260379010854 (6.7%) = ACCEPTED cyc0 TopHt AVH tie** (modernization #92 named this stand). The 6.7%
  is TopHt 32/live30 at the 2010 INVENTORY row (2/30) — the cornered AVH pre-sort tie; it propagates ~2 ft
  a few cycles then CONVERGES (2030 56/56, 2035 61/61). Not a new bug; carry as cornered. (Small secondary
  DG/mortality tail exists — TPA 3548/live3520 @2025 — but sub-dominant.)
- **1152014752290487 (6.5%) = NEW: loblolly-pine DG slightly HIGH.** Near-pure loblolly (FIA 111 = SN sp13,
  38/42 trees). Cyc0 BIT-EXACT (579/112/5.9); jl then grows DBH too fast (BA 129/live126 @2026 → SDI/QMD
  high → extra density mortality → TPA 447/live478 = −6.5% @2046). OPPOSITE direction to the YP gap (jl low).
  A distinct species-specific DG divergence — loblolly (sp13, a major planted SN species; special Fort-Bragg
  DG path exists). Next: per-tree DG diff on this stand — is it the planted modifier (kplant), an sp13 coeff,
  or an eco/fortype term for this stand's ECOREGION?

**SN multi-cycle status post-eco_unit-fix:** 5/8 bit-exact; residuals = 1 accepted AVH tie + 1 new loblolly
DG lead. The eco_unit fix cleared the dominant DG divergence class; remaining leads are narrower/species-specific.

### Slice 1k — SA(sp6) DG-high partially traced: NOT my fix, NOT fortype/phys (species term, open)
Corrected: the stand's dominant species is FVS **SA = sp6** (FIA 111), not loblolly-sp13 (both jl AND live
resolve FIA 111→sp6 here, so the mapping is consistent — not a mapping bug). Per-tree DG diff: jl SA DG
uniformly **~+0.10 higher** (mean +0.0998, relative ~25%). Ruled OUT (measured):
- **NOT a regression from the eco_unit fix:** SA `dg_phys_p232 = 0.0`, so on this 232Db→p232 stand the fix
  adds nothing for SA. (Fix confirmed safe.)
- **NOT the forest-type term:** jl derives `forest_type=142→ylpn` (yellow pine — correct for this pine
  stand); SA `dg_fortype_yellow_pine = 0.0`. So no fortype contribution either.
- jl context: `dg_const[SA]=0.6988`, `SI[SA]=102`. The +0.10 is some OTHER SA DDS term.
- Per-tree DDS match is currently MUDDY: FVS debug `D=` (3.29/4.59/5.59…) is ~0.5 below jl's DBH
  (3.9/5.0/6.2…) despite cyc0-bit-exact `.sum` — must resolve (bark/dib? tripled records? debug phase?)
  before decomposing the DDS term. OPEN — the campaign's 2nd substantive lead.

**NOTE — this refutes the earlier "loblolly sp13" framing in slice 1j** (it's sp6/SA). Magnitude is modest
(2–4% mid-projection, 6.5% TPA at the 2046 terminal cycle).

### Slice 1l — SA(sp6): site index RULED OUT (jl clamps correctly); narrowed to a per-species DG coefficient
- **Site index ruled out both-sides:** FVS uses SI=102 for SA (ISPC=6 dgf dump; SA's allowable range
  includes 102, NOT clamped — the `.out` clamp warnings are for OTHER site species: YP 144→135, BY 127→120,
  OS 67.5→55, …). jl also uses sp_site_index[SA]=102. Match.
- **jl DOES clamp site index (not a gap):** SITSET (`site_index.jl:56-85`) uses `site_index_min/max` — line
  66 clamps the site species to `simax`, and the per-species mapping stays within each species' [simin,simax].
  jl's derived YP=135 matches FVS's clamped 135; SA=102 matches. So the earlier "jl misses SI clamping"
  hypothesis is REFUTED — jl's site-index handling is faithful.
- ⇒ SA +0.10 DDS deficit is now cornered to a **per-species DG coefficient/term** (intercept/ln_dbh/dbh_sq/
  ln_crown/rel_ht/stand_ba/point_bal) — everything stand-level (site/slope/aspect/phys/fortype) matches.
  The dDG VARIES with tree DG (0.05–0.16), hinting a size/crown/BA-scaled term rather than a flat intercept.
  jl SA coeffs: intercept −1.641698, ln_dbh 1.461093, dbh_sq −0.00253, ln_crown 0.265872, rel_ht 0.069104,
  stand_ba −0.002939, point_bal −0.004873. Decisive next: compare these to FVS dgf.f DATA (INTERC at :399 +
  the b-arrays) for species 6 — a CSV-vs-blkdat coefficient diff.

**SA divergence magnitude:** modest (2–4% mid-projection, 6.5% terminal TPA) on one stand; not floor-blocking.

### Slice 1m — SA(sp6) ALL 8 dgf coefficients verified == FVS; narrowed to multi-point point-BAL input
Read FVS dgf.f DATA arrays, species-6 (SA) value == the CSV for **every** term:
INTERC −1.641698, LDBH 1.461093, DBH2 −0.002530, LCRWN 0.265872, ISIO 0.006851, HREL 0.069104,
PLTB(stand_ba) −0.002939, PNTBL(point_bal) −0.004873. **NOT a coefficient error** — extraction is correct.
Combined with site/phys/fortype/clamp all matching, the SA +0.10 DDS offset is a **stand-level INPUT** for
this stand, not the equation constants. 
- Prime suspect: **point-BAL** (`point_bal·pbal`, pbal = point-BA-in-larger × (1−cr/100)). This stand is a
  **dense multi-point FIA plot** (BA 112, 579 TPA); per-point PTBAA is the known harder multi-point-density
  area (cf. the modernization TCONDMLT/pccf per-point notes — jl faithful single-point, deferred multi-point).
  A per-point vs stand-point pbal difference × −0.004873, amplified by density, plausibly yields the +0.10.
- Secondary: `stand_ba·ba_v` (but cyc0 BA is bit-exact 112, so ba_v matches) or `rel_ht·(height/avh)`.
- Both-sides trace needed: dump FVS pbal (PTBAA per point) vs jl's for the SA trees; confirm the multi-point
  point-density path. If it's the multi-point PTBAA, this is a shared-density-model slice, not SN-specific.

**SA verdict:** NOT a coefficient bug; a stand-level competition-input divergence on dense multi-point FIA
plots — the campaign's 2nd substantive open item (modest magnitude, likely a multi-point density model slice).

## TODO
- [ ] NEXT: trace point-BAL (PTBAA per-point) FVS vs jl on 1152014752290487 — the SA +0.10 competition input.
      Likely the multi-point density model (shared engine), not a SN coefficient.
- [ ] Forest-type derivation: the YP −0.089 tail (separate stand).
- [ ] Scale differential to NE/CS/LS + larger SN sample; Pillar-1 stratified manifest.
- [ ] Forest-type derivation: still a candidate for the YP −0.089 tail (separate stand); trace fortyp.f vs jl.
- [ ] Scale differential to NE/CS/LS + larger SN sample; Pillar-1 stratified manifest.
- [ ] Residual: forest-type derivation for FIA stands (jl 503→upok −0.0907 vs FVS) — the −0.089 DDS tail;
      may surface on other plots where it crosses the rounding boundary. Trace fortyp.f vs jl for FIA input.
- [ ] NE/CS/LS: analogous eco-unit read (their FIA differentials — do they show the same EUT gap?).
- [ ] Then: forest-type derivation check (jl 503→upok vs FVS) for the residual ~0.09.
- [ ] Scale differential to NE/CS/LS + larger SN sample; Pillar-1 manifest.
      (both sides) vs jl; likely a beyond-growth-sample-max-DBH large-tree DG path YP-specific.
- [ ] After fix: re-run per-tree + stand differential (expect the 3.7% BA drift to collapse).
- [ ] Scale differential to NE/CS/LS + larger SN sample; build Pillar-1 stratified manifest.
- [ ] Track: jl 36 vs live 37 tree records at cyc0 on 3196569010661 (.sum TPA bit-exact ⇒ likely zero-TPA rec).
      which species' per-tree DBH increment diverges, and by how much (ULP vs systematic). Classifies
      accepted-DGSCOR vs real-gap and, if real, names the species/coefficient/path.
- [ ] Scale the differential to NE/CS/LS + larger SN sample once the SN driver is understood.
- [ ] Build the stratified per-variant plot manifest (Pillar 1).
- [ ] Scale the multi-cycle differential: larger SN sample + NE/CS/LS (Pillar 1 manifest feeds this).
- [ ] Build the stratified per-variant plot manifest (Pillar 1).
- [ ] Management-scenario differential on real plots (Pillar 3).
