# FVSsn → FVSjl faithfulness audit (operation-sequence trace)

Re-verifying the port by tracing FVS source op-by-op (NOT trusting tests, especially
FVSjulia-derived ones). Methodology: read the FVS call sequence, map each operation to
its FVSjl counterpart, verify the order + the stand state each op reads (pre/post thin,
pre/post growth). Where a mismatch is suspected, design a scenario and trace the values.

## Per-cycle driver: FVS tregro.f = GRINCR (compute increments) → GRADD (apply + bugs)

FVS splits the cycle: GRINCR computes DG/HTG/mortality (into increment arrays, NOT applied)
then GRADD applies them (UPDATE) plus fire/establishment/crown. FVSjl fuses both into
`grow_cycle!` (compute then apply inline). The canonical FVS order and the FVSjl mapping:

VERIFIED-FAITHFUL invariants (traced this session): DG/HTG/mortality are computed on the
PRE-growth dbh (increments stored, dbh updated only at step 16); MORTS runs before TRIPLE;
TRIPLE after MORTS; establishment after growth and before CROWN; the crown RELSDI reads the
post-thin pre-growth Reineke SDIAC (step 6 — was a bug, fixed). The mortality trajectory G,
the BAMAX/size-cap G, the SDI sums, DGSCOR/BACHLO RNG order, the species-sort IND1 order, and
the wk2/frmbase/COR/AUTCOR growth internals were all independently traced to live FVSsn.

## Findings

### F1 — Fire vs regular MORTS ordering (FFE only). STRUCTURAL MISMATCH; immaterial on tested stands.
FVS: GRINCR's **MORTS computes the regular (density+background) kill on the FULL pre-fire
stand**, then GRADD's FMKILL adds the fire kill; UPDATE applies both. FVSjl runs `_maybe_burn!`
(reduces TPA + recomputes density) BEFORE `mortality!`, so the regular density mortality sees
the REDUCED post-fire stand → less density mortality than FVS. Immaterial where density
mortality is inactive (snt01 stand-4 post-fire TPA matches bit-exact 240→107→104, so the
background-dominated regime is order-insensitive), but it WOULD diverge on a dense stand that
burns while above SDImax. To be fully faithful, regular MORTS should be computed on the
pre-fire stand (compute the kill, then apply fire, then apply the regular kill) — matching the
GRINCR(MORTS)→GRADD(FMKILL) split. NOT yet fixed (FFE-only; needs a dense-burn test to drive).

### F2 — COMPRESS (COMCUP) timing. Accepted-divergence-adjacent.
FVS runs COMCUP in GRINCR AFTER cuts+density+SDIAC (grincr.f:391); FVSjl's `apply_compress!`
runs BEFORE cuts (simulate.jl:201). COMPRESS is the accepted eigensolver divergence, but the
before/after-cuts timing changes which records exist when the thin runs — a potential
divergence beyond the eigensolver. Low priority (COMPRESS is explicitly accepted), flagged.

## Status
Core per-cycle sequence: traced and faithful. Two ordering items flagged (F1 fire/MORTS,
F2 COMPRESS), both currently immaterial to the passing tests but real faithfulness gaps to
close. Continue the audit into: volume (fvsvol op order), thinning selection (RDPSRT/cut
order), and the height-growth (HTGF) internals — each traced directly against live FVSsn.
