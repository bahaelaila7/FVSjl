# FVSjl — Non-ULP Divergence Fix Campaign (2026)

Drive every live-FVS divergence that is **neither Float32 ULP nor the accepted COMPRESS
eigensolver** to ULP-class, or prove it irreducible and document why. Oracle = live FVS
(sn/ne/cs_oracle.sh; debug-stamp the .f, relink, restore). Doctrine: trace logic both
sides → upstream-first → validate vs LIVE before writing the test → document every
verdict → variant-aware (gate, don't harden; keep all three variants bit-exact).

Status: ⬜ open · 🔬 investigating · ✅ fixed-to-ULP · 📌 irreducible/deferred (why documented)

| # | Divergence | Layer (upstream→down) | Magnitude vs live | Status |

## Verdict log

### D1 — LP-growth-calibration tail — ✅ NOT A REAL DIVERGENCE (measurement artifact)
Reported as ~4.8 TPA / 0.8″ QMD on mix_lp_hi. **Disproven**: `run_keyfile` on mix_lp_hi is BIT-EXACT vs
live FVSsn every cycle (only 1995 Tcuft Δ1 = ULP). The "drift" came from my tolerance-probe loop OMITTING
the per-cycle `compute_forest_type!` — FORTYP (520, ported) feeds diameter growth, so a stale forest type
shifted DG. With FORTYP recomputed each cycle (as the real test does), all 10 multicycle scenarios match
live to print-rounding (TPA ≤0.57, cuft ≤1.0). multicycle re-tightened to uniform atol=1 (bogus mix_lp_hi
carve-out removed). LESSON: re-trace a "tail" through the actual production path before believing a probe.

### D2 — FINT≠5 calibration volume residual — 🔬 REAL, ~0.4% cuft
growth_fint10 (GROWTH diameter-measurement FINT=10, SCALE=YR/FINT=0.5, dgdriv.f:325): TPA/SDI/TopHt
bit-exact, BA ±1, but Tcuft 1995 live 2848 / jl 2835 (Δ13, 0.46%), 2000 live 3308 / jl 3295. Committed
growth_fint10.sum.save MATCHES live ⇒ not stale; genuine. growth_idg1 (FINT=5) is fully bit-exact ⇒
FINT-specific. Next: debug-stamp the live dgdriv FINT-scale path; BA-exact-but-cuft-off ⇒ sub-integer DBH
diff, likely the DDS→DBH back-calc under SCALE=0.5.
