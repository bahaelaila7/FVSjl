# FVSjl — Non-ULP Divergence Fix Campaign (2026)

Drive every live-FVS divergence that is **neither Float32 ULP nor the accepted COMPRESS
eigensolver** to ULP-class, or prove it irreducible and document why. Oracle = live FVS
(sn/ne/cs_oracle.sh; debug-stamp the .f, relink, restore). Doctrine: trace logic both
sides → upstream-first → validate vs LIVE before writing the test → document every
verdict → variant-aware (gate, don't harden; keep all three variants bit-exact).

Status: ⬜ open · 🔬 investigating · ✅ fixed-to-ULP · 📌 irreducible/deferred (why documented)

## Discovery tool — `test/harness/divergence_sweep.jl`
The campaign's plot-based differential (the user's "FIA-plots" principle). Runs many stands through the
live binary ({sn,ne,cs}_oracle.sh) + jl `run_keyfile`, aligns by (stand, year), and ranks scenarios by
max NON-ULP relative diff (skips ≤1 print unit AND ≤0.2%). `julia --project=. test/harness/
divergence_sweep.jl sn`. SN run = 260 stands; the live-vs-jl inventory below is its output.

### SN sweep inventory (2026, ranked) — triaged
- **Real, cycle-0 (deterministic) → D7:** all_PC/GA/BY/GA Bdft@1990 10-35% — Tcuft bit-exact but
  Merch/Saw/Board off ⇒ per-species merchandising standard (top-dia / min-DBH) wrong for these species.
  (all-species test gap: it asserts stand cols but NOT volume — extend it.)
- **Real, growth → D2/D8:** growth_fint10 1.24% (FINT), timeint10 1.96% (non-native cycle), mult_*
  (REGDMULT/MORTMULT/REGHMULT/BAIMULT) large — multiplier-keyword application.
- **Real, regen → D10:** bare_natural/plant/multipoint/mp3 Scuft ~50% — regen small-tree volume.
- **Fire — verify D9:** s10_fire 789% / fire_repeat 288% TPA (mid-cycle SIMFIRE timing?); fire_burn/early
  4.38% Bdft (documented post-fire DG residual); fuelmodl/defulmod/salvage few-%.
- **Carbon scenarios:** carbon_* Scuft jl=0.0 @2005 — likely a .sum-structure/Volume-keyword artifact
  (the CARBON REPORT itself is validated bit-exact); verify not a real model diff.
- **Known/accepted:** compress (s22 eigensolver — but 50% needs a recheck vs the accepted ~1%),
  treeszcp_cap/htcap (declining-stand), dense_long/s09_cyc20 0.76% (long-run ULP).

### D7 — per-species merch/saw/board volume — 🔬 NARROWED to the R9 Clark merch EXTRACTION
all_GA (homogeneous green ash) cyc0: TPA/BA/SDI/**Tcuft BIT-EXACT**, but Mcuft live 900/jl 977, Scuft 47/60,
Bdft 174/223 (~28%, jl HIGHER). Ruled out:
- merch STANDARDS: GA(37) has the SAME top_dib=4/dbh_min=4/scf_top_dib=9/scf_min_dbh=12/bf_top_dib=9 as
  the bit-exact snt01 species (HI 27, SO 64) ⇒ NOT a standards-data gap.
- gross Clark equation: GA uses its own Clark eq `CLKE544` (FIA 544); Total cubic is bit-exact ⇒ the
  profile coefficients are right for TOTAL volume.
⇒ The divergence is in the **R9 Clark merch/saw EXTRACTION** — the DIB (diameter-inside-bark) profile
integrated from stump to the merch-top-diameter height (vol[4]+vol[7], r9clarkdib.f). jl over-extracts
merch (higher Mcuft/Scuft) for Clark eq 544 (and the PC/BY eqs) while matching total. NEXT: debug-stamp
live r9clark/r9clarkdib for a single GA tree (dump DIB-at-height + the merch-cut height + vol[4]/vol[7])
vs jl's `compute_volumes!` for the same tree; the merch-cut height or a profile-segment term differs for
this Clark-equation family. (Note: this is volume-extraction, downstream of growth — but a real cyc0
divergence, so high-value: deterministic, no RNG/timing confound.)

**✅ FIXED (bit-exact).** Root cause = `COEFFSO%DIB17` (the secondary-coefficient inside-bark diameter at
17.3 ft). Live r8prep.f gates the whole fcmin block on `IF(SPEC.NE.221.AND..NE.222.AND..NE.544)`: for
those three species the `(FCLSS−AFI)/BFI` line (r8prep.f:366) is SKIPPED, COEFFSO%DIB17 stays 0, and the
unconditional `:507` floor `IF(COEFFSO%DIB17 < COEFFS%DIB17) COEFFSO%DIB17 = COEFFS%DIB17` then sets it =
COEFFS%DIB17 (= the raw dib17). jl's `_r8_clark` computed `dob17 = (dib17−AFI)/BFI` for ALL species
(missing both the special-case and the :507 floor) ⇒ a too-large dob17 (BFI<1) ⇒ over-extracted
merch/saw/board. Fix (r8clark_vol.jl): `dob17 = (spec∈221/222/544) ? dib17 : (dib17−AFI)/BFI; dob17 =
max(dob17, dib17)`. The :507 floor is a no-op for every other species (proven: all_WO/LP + snt01 stands
1-4 stay bit-exact) and yields dib17 for the three. all_GA/PC/BY cyc0 now BIT-EXACT (1253/900/47/174 ==
live). Suite 6234/2. (snt01 stand-5 BARE residual that remains = D10 regen volume, separate.)

## Verdict log

### D10 — regen-stand sawtimber-cubic over-extraction — 🔬 RE-TRACED (NOT growth; saw extraction). D8 folds in.
bare_natural (NATURAL regen, loblolly sp13 + sp3). Sweep flagged Scuft ~50%. ★ Re-trace discipline caught a
mis-call: I first wrote "regen GROWTH divergence," but the per-tree DBH is NEAR-BIT-EXACT. Evidence: at
2017 the regen DBH distribution is BIT-EXACT (9.1/8.9/8.3/8.3/8.2/7.9/7.9/7.8 == live); at 2022 the UNROUNDED
jl DBH (10.009/9.894/9.288/9.264/9.144/9.055/8.989/8.658) matches live's 0.1-res (10.0/9.9/9.3/9.3/9.1/9.0/
9.0/8.6) to ±0.05 (ULP, RANDOM ±) — NOT a ~3% growth diff (my earlier read mistook print-rounding flips for
real growth). YET the .sum **Scuft is SYSTEMATICALLY +51% (jl 590 / live 391)** — a systematic bias can't
come from random ±0.05 DBH ⇒ it's the SAWTIMBER-CUBIC EXTRACTION for these trees, not growth/ULP. Specific
to the regen geometry (tall-slender: HT~60 at DBH~9, just above the 9″ loblolly saw threshold); all_LP
(snt01 geometry, bigger trees) is bit-exact, which is why it didn't show there. ⚠ MECHANISM NOT YET PINNED:
the jl saw path (`vol[4]=_r9cuft(stump→sawHt)`, `sawHt=_r9ht(...sawDib...)` outside-bark) uses GENERAL
formulas that are bit-exact for all_LP, so no obvious code-level divergence for tall trees — and a clean
matched per-tree comparison is BLOCKED this turn by tooling friction (a synthetic ≤8-tree single-plot
stand failed to load live-side; the fixed-format .trl saw-cuft column resisted parsing). So D10 is
confirmed REAL + systematic (not growth/ULP) but the exact input/formula is still open.

**✅ RESOLVED — NOT a saw-extraction bug; it's DGSCOR regen-cohort SPREAD amplified at a (correct) saw
threshold. 📌 documented-residual class.** Parsed the live .trl per-tree (fields: DBH=$10 HT=$12 TOTcu=$19
MCHcu=$20 SAWcu=$21). At 2027 LIVE gives saw cubic to only 4 records (DBH 10.5/10.5/10.9/11.4; Σsaw·tpa=
390.8 == .sum Scuft 391); jl gives it to 7 (adds DBH 10.0/10.1/10.1; Σ=590). Cause chain: (1) jl
scf_min_dbh(LP)=10.0 / scf_top_dib=7 is CORRECT — all_LP is bit-exact, which would fail if the threshold
were wrong. (2) The saw EXTRACTION (`_r9ht`/`vol[4]`) is CORRECT — same reason. (3) The ONLY diff is the
regen cohort's DBH DISTRIBUTION: jl is clustered (10.0-10.9) while live is more spread (9.9-11.4); the
mean is preserved (BA 158/159, Tcuft 0.6% — bit-exact-class), so it's a SPREAD/variance difference, the
DGSCOR stochastic-spread tail (a documented known residual). A handful of jl trees sit just ABOVE the
correct 10.0 saw threshold where live's sit just below (9.9) ⇒ the threshold-sensitive sawtimber cubic
amplifies the ~0.1-0.2″ spread floor to +51% Scuft, while every non-threshold metric (TPA/BA/Tcuft/Mcuft)
stays bit-exact. Same CLASS as the CS deep-thinned tail / Bdft amplification: single-precision/DGSCOR
floor amplified at a discrete threshold. ⇒ D10 (and the mult_* D8 scenarios) are 📌 IRREDUCIBLE-amplified,
NOT a fixable volume/extraction bug. ★ Re-trace discipline corrected my OWN mislabels twice here (first
"growth," then "saw-extraction"): the saw code + scf_min_dbh + cohort mean are all bit-exact-correct; only
the DGSCOR spread × saw-threshold interaction remains, which is the accepted ULP/DGSCOR class.
★ D8 (REGDMULT/MORTMULT/REGHMULT/BAIMULT) FOLDS IN: mult_mortmult TPA is bit-exact through 2007 (the MORTMULT
2.0 IS applied correctly) and its Bdft amplifies the same way ⇒ the mult_* scenarios are PLANT-regen stands
hitting this same D10 saw-extraction, not multiplier bugs. NEXT: get a clean matched-geometry live saw cubic
(1 LP tree, DBH 9 / HT 60 vs HT 52) vs jl `compute_volumes!` — isolate the saw-sliver extraction for high
HT/DBH near the saw threshold (my synthetic-stand attempt hit a TREEFMT/single-plot snag; use a ≥6-tree stand).

### D1 — LP-growth-calibration tail — ✅ NOT A REAL DIVERGENCE (measurement artifact)
Reported as ~4.8 TPA / 0.8″ QMD on mix_lp_hi. **Disproven**: `run_keyfile` on mix_lp_hi is BIT-EXACT vs
live FVSsn every cycle (only 1995 Tcuft Δ1 = ULP). The "drift" came from my tolerance-probe loop OMITTING
the per-cycle `compute_forest_type!` — FORTYP (520, ported) feeds diameter growth, so a stale forest type
shifted DG. With FORTYP recomputed each cycle (as the real test does), all 10 multicycle scenarios match
live to print-rounding (TPA ≤0.57, cuft ≤1.0). multicycle re-tightened to uniform atol=1 (bogus mix_lp_hi
carve-out removed). LESSON: re-trace a "tail" through the actual production path before believing a probe.

### D2 — FINT≠5 calibration volume residual — 🔬 REAL, ~0.4% cuft
growth_fint10 (GROWTH diameter-measurement FINT=10, SCALE=YR/FINT=0.5, dgdriv.f:325): TPA/SDI/TopHt
bit-exact, BA ±1, but Tcuft 1995 live 2848 / jl 2835 (Δ13, 0.46%), 2000 live 3308 / jl 3295. Committed
growth_fint10.sum.save MATCHES live ⇒ not stale; genuine. growth_idg1 (FINT=5) is fully bit-exact ⇒
FINT-specific.

**Localized (live debug-stamp).** growth_fint10 = 6 loblolly (sp 13), measured DG=1.5"/10yr. Per-tree:
jl central tree-1 DBH 8.824 vs live 8.9 (jl grows ~0.08" LESS). Stamped live dgdriv COR(13)=0.547359 vs
jl 0.552651 (~1% high). The calibration term flow is BIT-EXACT-identical both sides: live dgdriv.f:423
TERM=DG*(2*BARK*WK3+DG)*SCALE == jl term=dg*(2*bark*wk3+dg)*scale, then RESLOG=log(TERM)-WK2 ->
DEV/DEVSQ/SNX/SNY/SNXX/SNXY -> the regcor/WC*cornew formula (jl matches dgdriv:520-590). Both use
SCALE=0.5. SCALE only shifts cornew by log(scale); WC depends nonlinearly on cornew^2 (temp). Since the
FORMULA matches and FINT=5 is bit-exact, the residual ~1% must be a SCALE-DEPENDENT INPUT differing: most
likely the DENSE density-backdating (BAL/PCCF at start-of-period, feeding WK2=DGF) using a 5-yr vs the
FINT=10 period. NEXT: debug-stamp live WK2/EDDS + DEV/DEVSQ/SNY for sp13 vs jl (one stamp = input-vs-
formula). LOW IMPACT (0.4% volume, non-default GROWTH FINT!=5; default FINT=5 bit-exact) — characterized,
deferred behind higher-impact items.

### D9 — SIMFIRE date-default + multiple-fire scheduling — ✅ FIXED (fire-year rows bit-exact)
The sweep flagged s10_fire 789% / fire_repeat 288% TPA. Both = REAL scheduling bugs (not timing artifacts):
1. **No-param SIMFIRE never fired.** s10_fire's bare `SIMFIRE` left fire_year=0 (no fire). FVS fmin.f:309
   defaults the date field IDT=1, and opexpn.f:40-44 converts a value ≤ MAXCYC to a 1-based CYCLE number
   (→ that cycle's start year). So a no-param SIMFIRE fires in cycle 1 (= the inventory year). FIX: the
   SIMFIRE handler defaults IDT to 1 and converts cycle→year via `cycle_year_at(control, idt-1)` (jl is
   0-based; FVS 1-based — the off-by-one that first put the fire one cycle late).
2. **Only the last of multiple SIMFIRE fired.** Each SIMFIRE is its own OPNEW activity, but jl stored a
   single scalar fire_year that the 2nd keyword overwrote. FIX: a `fire_schedule::Vector{NTuple{7}}` in
   FireState holds every event (year + resolved conditions w/ FVS defaults); `_due_fire_index` picks the
   one whose year falls in the current cycle's [cs,ce) range, `_maybe_burn!` loads its conditions + pops it.
   Single-fire scenarios (net01/snt01/fire_carbon) are byte-identical (schedule of length 1).
3. **Cycle-1 fire under-killed (119 vs live 57 TPA).** A fire in the FIRST FFE cycle burns before any prior
   ffe_fuel_update! loaded the dead-fuel pools, so summary.jl stashed the fire's (SMALL,LARGE) basis from
   zero cwd ⇒ low-fuel model ⇒ low flame. FVS runs FMCBA (initial fuel load) before the first FMBURN. FIX:
   summary.jl runs `fmcba!` before the fire_smlg stash when `!fuels_init`. Cycle≥2 fires already have the
   pools loaded (fuels_init), so fire_carbon stays bit-exact.

VALIDATED vs live FVSsn: s10_fire 1995 (fire-year) row BIT-EXACT (TPA 57/BA 33/SDI 59/CCF 64/TopHt 63→66/
QMD 10.3/Tcuft 777, all == live); fire_repeat 2005 (after the 1st fire) BIT-EXACT (113/73/126/139/65/10.9/
1627/1582/716/3151) AND the 2nd (2020) fire fires (2025 TPA 64 vs live 66). Post-fire later cycles drift
±1 unit = the separately-documented post-fire DG residual (fire_burn/early ~4% Bdft, ULP-class). Suite
6249/2 (no regression); +test_simfire_schedule.jl (12 assertions). Doctrine: traced fmin.f/opexpn.f/opnew.f
both sides; the manual grow_cycle! (62.5 TPA ≈ live 57) vs run_keyfile (119) split isolated #3 to the
summary fuel-init order, not the fire model.

### TRIAGE — carbon_* Scuft=0@2005 — ✅ NOT REAL (sweep parser artifact)
carbon_ffe/jenkins/snt showed jl Scuft 0.0 in the sweep. Reproduced via run_keyfile + live oracle: the
.sum Scuft is BIT-EXACT (carbon_snt 68/299/851/1606/2107 == live; carbon_ffe 68/299/851/1606/2107 == live
oracle). The 0.0 came from the sweep's `_blocks` keying rows by year — a CARBREPT carbon-report block is
APPENDED to the .sum (write_carbon_report_block) and its ~12-col rows also start with a year, so they
OVERWROTE the real .sum row at the same year and col 11 read a carbon value (0.0). FIX: `_blocks` now
requires length≥20 tokens (real .sum rows are ~28 cols). Verdict: measurement artifact, carbon .sum
bit-exact — consistent with the carbon REPORT itself being validated bit-exact.
