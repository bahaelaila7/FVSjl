# fire/fuel_additions.jl — FFE annual fuel additions (FMCADD, fire/base/fmcadd.f).
#
# Each YEAR (the FFE fuel update runs annually, fmmain.f:226-259 with NYRS=1) live trees add debris to
# the surface-fuel pools `fire.cwd`:
#   - litterfall: foliage biomass ÷ leaf lifespan → the size-10 litter pool (this routine);
#   - woody crown breakage (LIMBRK) + crown-lift dead material → woody pools (chunk 2b);
#   - snag-crown falldown from the CWD2B debris-in-waiting pool (chunk 2b, couples to snag.jl).
# Material enters the tree species' decay class (`dkr_cls`). Foliage comes from `crown_biomass`
# (FMCROWE) and is in FFE-internal pounds; P2T = 1/2000 converts to tons/acre.

const _FM_LIMBRK = 0.01f0   # woody-crown limb-breakage fraction per year (sn/fmvinit.f:126)
const _FM_P2T = 1f0 / 2000f0

"""
    fmcadd_litterfall!(s) -> StandState

Add ONE year of foliage litterfall to the FFE litter pool (FMCADD, fmcadd.f:72-76): for each live
tree, `foliage · TPA / LEAFLF(sp) · P2T` tons/ac into `cwd[10, hard, dkr_cls(sp)]`. This is the term
that offsets the 0.65/yr litter decay so the forest-floor pool holds up. No-op unless FFE is active.
(Woody breakage + snag falldown are the companion FMCADD terms — chunk 2b.)
